# Automated-University-Course-Web-Scraper
Developed an automated web scraper for a client that fetches data from a dynamic javascript enabled website
containing course data for the University of Windsor and stores it in an Excel file every 20 minutes using
Python, Selenium and Visual Basic Advanced (VBA). Created a macro button in Excel to run VBA code
and start the Python script. Utilized ’xlwings’ library to facilitate data collection into a pandas dataframe
and establish connection between Python and Excel.
